# Healing Rain
*A positive community for gamers with disabilities, disorders, and differences.*

---

## Goal of Project:
To create a positive community for gamers with disabilities, disorders, and differences.

## Why We Need This:
Research has shown that gaming can have significant positive impact on an individual's social, personal, and physical rehabilitation. Despite these benefits, gaming communities are often inaccessible or profoundly negative. Everyone deserves access to a helpful, positive community where they are free to be themselves.

## Our Mission:
We aim to deliver positive, accessible information to help improve the gaming experience for all types of gamers. We hope to foster an inclusive, positive community based on helping and healing. Basically, stack positives like you hope your in-game healer stacks heals.

## How We Aim To Do This:
Forum, research db with tags/labels, microposts highlighting accessible features in games, featuring positive articles about gaming/benefits/inclusiveness, advocacy campaigns, summarizing research for non-scientists, listing companies/conferences/charities trying to make a difference, member twitch streams

## Code of Conduct:
There will be a comprehensive code of conduct that enforces an overall positive feel to all materials on the site that maintains a standard of language that is free from any form of discrimination (including but not limited to: disability, mental health, race, nationality, religion, gender identity, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, body size, and physical appearance).

## What We Are Not:
This is not a space to rant about how inaccessible games are, how poorly you are treated by gamebros, or to rate games. There are lots of other outlets for that and this is NOT one of them.

## What We Need:
Developers, logo/mascot design, accessibility experts, research experts, forum moderators, idea people. Every little thing counts.
